*Basics of Git  Branching*
by Franklin Dawes

Creating a New Branch: _git branch <branch_name>_

Switching to a Branch: _git checkout <branch_name>_

*ON YOUR BRANCH => Coding…Coding…aaaand Time to Commit*
_git add ._ 
_git commit_
_git push origin <branch_name>_

*You can push and create a pull request to merge your changes into the master branch*

I recommend this route :point_up::skin-tone-5:

*IF YOU ARE UNABLE to merge your pull request THEN….*

_1. git checkout master_
_2. git pull_

_3. git checkout <your_branch_name>_
_4. git merge master_
_5. manually fix conflicts_

_6. git add .
_7. git commit 
_8. git push origin <your_branch_name>_

*Now Go To GitHub and Create a New Pull Request*
_Merge your branch into the master through the pull request method._

_You can delete your branch from GitHub *after* you’ve merged it into the master branch successfully. (They give you that option after you merge)_

*Go Back To Your Terminal*
1. _git checkout master_
2. _git pull origin master_
3. _git branch -d <your_branch_name>_ (delete branch)
4. *GO BACK TO THE TOP OF THIS and REPEAT*
